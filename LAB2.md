View the gedit man page.
Use the man -k ext4 command to find the command to
tune ext4 file-system parameters.
Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings
of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of
strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the
text that precedes or follows the brace definition.
