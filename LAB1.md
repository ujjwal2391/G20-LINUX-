Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice
files to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the
numbers 1 through 6. Create six files with names of the
form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three
subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the
subdirectories friends, family, and work. Use a single
command to create all three subdirectories at the same
time
